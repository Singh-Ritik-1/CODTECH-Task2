* Overview of Hospital Management System Project:

- Objective:
- The primary goal of this Hospital Management System (HMS) project is to provide an integrated platform for managing various aspects of a hospital's operations, including patient registration, staff management, inventory management, and appointment scheduling. It aims to streamline hospital processes, enhance data security, and support role-based access for different users.

-Features:
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
- Admin, Doctor, and Nurse roles with distinct access permissions.
- Secure login and password management with AES encryption for password security.

*Patient Management:
- Register new patients with personal details and medical history.
- View and manage patient records.

*Staff Management:
- Add new staff members and view existing staff details.
- Role assignment for staff.

*Inventory Management:
- View and manage medical supplies.
- Add new supplies and track inventory levels.

*Appointment Scheduling:
- Schedule appointments for patients.
- View and manage appointments.

*Data Security:
- AES encryption for secure password storage and authentication.

*Technology Used:
- Programming Language: Java
- Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for password security.
- Data Storage: In-memory storage using Java Collections (e.g., ArrayList and HashMap).

*Implementation Highlights:

*Class Structure:
- Patient, Staff, Appointment, MedicalSupply, and Billing classes for managing different entities.
- Role-based access control is implemented through role and password maps.

*User Interaction:
- Command-line interface (CLI) for user input and system navigation.
- Scanner class for reading user input.

This project serves as a foundational tool for managing hospital operations, demonstrating basic concepts of encryption, role-based access, and system management in a Java environment.
